Create some scripts that help me

1-) Set up Linux 
When I install a new Linux, I need to install some packages and configure some things. This script will help me to do this.

- run `make step-1`
- after finish, make a linux logout
- run `make step-2` to finish installation

This scripts will install:
- *vim*, *curl*, *git*
- *zsh* and *oh-my-zsh*
    - will clear your zshrc file and create a new one with configs 
- *asdf* with *node* and *go* plugins
